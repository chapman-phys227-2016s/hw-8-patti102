# PHYS227 HW 8

**Author:** Taylor Patti

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-8-patti102.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chapman-phys227-2016s/hw-8-patti102)

**Due date:** 2016/04/14

## Specification

Complete the following exercises from the primary textbook, placing your solutions into separate files. In each file, write the solution as a callable function, so that you can write suitable test functions that demonstrate correct output using the nose framework. GitHub will automatically run your tests on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework with build status above.

1. Exercise 8.37 (```disorder2.py```) *Hint:* Use your CW8 vectorized class as a base class for this exercise.  Subclass that class to create a new random walk class that can handle boundaries.  Use the ideas from Exercise 8.35 and 8.36 to implement the boundary detection for a box with a holey divider.  As with the classwork, create an animated gif of your final result to show that it works as expected, and display it in your notebook as an image in a Markdown cell.

Finally, to cleanly present your work, create a Jupyter notebook ```hw8.ipynb``` that imports each of your python files as modules and demonstrates the functionality. The notebook should be formatted professionally using Markdown headings, including your name and a brief description of each homework section.

## Assessment

This assignment was very cool. It was not too long. It was fun. I did learn things. I did have to read, think, and consider things before I programmed. So yeah, I learned, and I'm happy about it. You tricked me! You win.

## Honor Pledge

I pledge that all the work in this repository is my own with only the following exceptions:

* Content of starter files supplied by the instructor;
* Code borrowed from another source, documented with correct attribution in the code and summarized here.

I looked up error codes. As always.

Signed,
